# Task 3.4: Circle calculation with console output

Create a new Circle class and add a main method to the class. The class should calculate both the

- circumference and
- the surface of the circle
  The radius is read from the keyboard. After the calculation, the two
  calculated values should be output to the console.

```
Enter a radius: 5.0
Circumference: 31.41592653589793
Area: 78.53981633974483
```

- Use the predefined `Math.PI` constant for the calculation.
- Here the formulas:
    - circle circumference:   U=2*π* r
    - circle area:        A=π* r^2

Then, test your programme with different radii.
