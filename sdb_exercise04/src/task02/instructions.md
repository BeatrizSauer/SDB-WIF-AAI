# Task 4.2: If-Else-Statements
In this exercise task, you'll train to work with if-else statements in your code.

## 1. Let's go to Lake Chiemsee!

- Write the sentence **“If it’s sunny, OR if the temperature is greater than 26 and it’s not raining, I will go to 
   lake
   Chiemsee.”** as a Java if statement using an int variable temperature and boolean variables sunny and raining. If the
   conditional is true, print out “Go to lake Chiemsee!”. So, you will go to lake Chiemsee on days that it is sunny in
   any
   temperature, or you will go to lake Chiemsee on days when the temperature is over 26 degrees and it’s not raining.

- Test your code by trying the given values. Is it resulting with the expected result?

| sunny | raining | temperature | Let's go to lake Chiemsee! |
|-------|---------|-------------|----------------------------|
| true  | false   | 19          | true                       |
| true  | false   | 28          | true                       |
| false | true    | 10          | false                      |
| false | true    | 29          | false                      |
| false | false   | 32          | true                       |


## 2. Determine Maximum
The maximum determines the largest number from a selection of available numbers. 

Write a program that determines the maximum of three integer variables and outputs it in the command line. Use only if- and else-statements as well as the >-operator for the comparisons.

Test cases:
- Given numbers: 1,2,3 -> Maximum: 3
- Given numbers: 42,7,13 -> Maximum: 42
- Given numbers: -9,4,2 -> Maximum: 4
- Given numbers: 2,2,2 -> Maximum 2
- Given numbers: -2,-3,-4 -> Maximum -2
