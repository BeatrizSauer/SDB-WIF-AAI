# Task 6.1: Countries Array

In this exercise, you will create a guide to different countries using arrays.

1. In a separate class `Countries.java`, create 3 parallel arrays and initialize them using initialization lists that
represent the data below.

Remember that the order of these arrays has to match so that you can use the same index and get corresponding values
out.

>- Countries: China, Egypt, France, Germany, India, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, United Kingdom, United States
>- Capitals: Beijing, Cairo, Paris, Berlin, New Delhi, Tokyo, Nairobi, Mexico City, London, Washington D.C.
>- Languages: Chinese, Arabic, French, German, Hindi, Japanese, Swahili, Spanish, English, English

2. Choose a random number within 0 to the length of one of the arrays using the Random Class and save it in a 
   variable 
   called 
   `index`.

3. Print out the country name, its capital, and its language for that country using the random index to access the
corresponding item in each parallel array.
