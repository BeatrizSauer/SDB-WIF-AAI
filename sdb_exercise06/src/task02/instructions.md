# Task 6.2: Traversing Arrays and accessing array content

1. Define a method `reverse` to reverse the elements in an `int` array `a` that is passed into the method. `reverse` 
   doesn't return a value;

> **Understanding**: What does call-by-value mean in this task? Why does the method not have to return the array, but the changes are still visible in the main method?

2. Define a method `average` that returns the average of the first 3 items in the array `a` that is passed into 
   the method.

3. Define a method `getLargest` that returns the largest value in an integer array `a` that is passed into the 
   method.

**Test:** Test all your methods within a `main` method for {2,3,4,5,6}.

**Attention:** Methods should be implemented in a general way, so we don't limit ourselves to a specific array size. We want to have methods that can handle different sizes! Implement your methods in this way and test them with different data sets such as {16,23,199,100,33,22,76,34,17,88} and/or {1,2,3,...,100};
